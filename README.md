## Description
This is a simple framework/template used whenever I create a new discord.js client/bot. It's simple to understand, quick/easy to modify and best of all, it's licensed under MIT; meaning you can make adjustments/personal improvements wherever you want.

## Discord
Always wanted to make your own Discord bot but you're not sure where to start? Come join my [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/KfHFhGNPvz), I'll try and answer all the questions you have in there. I'm also willing to help out with any current projects you might have!

### Hosting
**1)** `cd` into your project folder

**2)** Run the command: `git clone https://github.com/Destinovant/discord.js-bot-framework`

**3)** Run the command `cd discord.js-bot-framework`

**4)** `npm i` to install all dependencies

**5)** Copy and paste `.env.example`, than rename it to `.env`

**6)** Open the new `.env` file and provide your bot token and MongoDB link

**7)** `node .` to start the application or `npm run dev` if you have `nodemon` installed for automatic restarts on changes
